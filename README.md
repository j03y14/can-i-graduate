**Simple and Easy Graduation Criteria Management Website**

"Can I Graduate?" (in Korean, "나 졸업할 수 있겠니?") is a website which shows graduation criteria of universities easily. This helps students to know what they must do to graduate successfully.

## Motivation

Many students in universities don’t know what the graduation criteria are exactly because those are too complex and hard to find. As a result, it makes students to be confused when they are ahead of graduation. At this point, if there is a system which shows graduation criteria easily and simply, lots of students will be happy.
